### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Hassaan** (correct, my first name is not *Syed* ðŸ˜„). I'm a curious engineering manager with a passion for cloud-scale data engineering. Having worked in and now living in my 4th country, it has not only enabled me to operate fluently in diverse teams, it has also broadened my analytical horizons. 

In my current role at Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering (CSE), I'm leading a team of talented and hard-working developers that empower top Azure customers to achieve more and drive the value of intelligent cloud and edge through great software engineering.

### Things I believe (*in no particular order*)

- As a manager/lead, if things go well, give your team the credit. If things go sideways, take the blame yourself.
- Always keep learning. Teach yourself multiple ways of solving the same problem.
- The term *best practices* is relative. Best practices constantly change over time. Brace yourself to unlearn and re-learn.
- People over processes.
- New systems are best designed by a small number of minds, not committees.
- Judge people on their contributions, not on how confident they seem.
- Don't let your own desire to get things done quickly turn into undue pressure on your peers.
- Code is a liability, not an asset.
- [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
- Automate all the things that can be automated.
- Have the same high standards for all the code you write, from tests, little scripts to the inner loop of your critical system.
- It doesn't matter if you write the tests first, last, or in the middle, but all code must have good tests.
- Main branch should always be deployable to prod. Deploy from main to prod from the very beginning of a project.
- Being able to tell what your system is doing is crucial, so make sure itâ€™s observable.
- Have someone in the team who owns the overall vision and direction of a system. Without it, the architecture will degrade over time as it gets pulled in different directions.
- Out of all the agile practices commonly used, estimating task sizes and trying to measure project velocity is the least useful.
- Beware of hyped or fashionable tech (looking at you Kubernetes ðŸ˜‰). CS and engineering fundamentals donâ€™t change much over time.
- Choose your data storage backend according to the shape of data, types of queries, read/write patterns and performance requirements.
