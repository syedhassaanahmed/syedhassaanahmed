### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious Engineering Manager with 16+ years of experience in developing Software and leading Software development teams. I'm particularly passionate about Data and Analytics solutions in the Public Cloud. Living in four countries has enabled me to effectively collaborate in teams with diverse backgrounds. Working across industries such as Retail, Government, Telco, Ad Tech, Manufacturing and Energy has helped me understand a wide array of business domains.

In my current role at Microsoft Industry Solutions Engineering (ISE), I lead a team of talented and meticulous developers that empower strategically important Microsoft Azure customers through high-impact co-innovation and co-engineering.â€‹

### Great Software Engineers from my observation (*in no particular order*)

- teach themselves multiple ways of solving the same problem and understand that code is just one of the many ways to achieve the solution.
- treat code as a liability, not an asset.
- prioritize building for current requirements over hypothetical future ones aka [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
- consider the term *best practices* as relative. Since best practices constantly evolve over time, great engineers brace themselves to unlearn and re-learn.
- never settle in learning in-depth how something works.
- put people over processes.
- judge people on their contributions, not on how confident they seem.
- don't let their own desire to get things done quickly, turn into undue pressure on peers.
- recognize that out of all the agile practices commonly used, estimating work items and trying to measure project velocity is the least productive.
- acknowledge that new systems are best designed by a small number of minds, not committees.
- are aware that their team is only as good as the weakest code reviewer.
- are cautious when dealing with hyped/fashionable tech (e.g. Kubernetes) and understand that CS fundamentals donâ€™t change much over time.
- ensure that all code must have good tests regardless if the tests were written first, last, or in the middle.
- have the same high standards for all the code they write, from tests, little scripts to the inner loop of critical system.
- deploy from main branch to prod from the very beginning of a project.
- automate all the things that are worth automating.
- know the importance of being able to tell what the system is doing, so they make sure itâ€™s observable.
- choose data storage solution according to the shape of data, types of queries, read/write patterns and performance requirements.
- As managers/leads, if things go well, they give their team the credit. If things go sideways, they take the blame themselves.
