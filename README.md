### Hi there 👋

I'm a curious Engineering Manager with 18+ years of experience in developing software and leading engineering teams. Having lived in 5 countries, I've learned to collaborate effectively with multi-disciplinary and geo-distributed teams. Having worked across industries such as Retail, Telco, Manufacturing and Energy, enables me to drive engineering excellence, business value, and customer success.

### Values of well-rounded Software Engineers in my opinion (*in no particular order*)

- Learn multiple ways of solving the same problem and know the pros and cons.
- Code is just one of the many ways of achieving a solution.
- Code is a liability, not an asset.
- Beware of the [sunk cost fallacy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sunkcost.asp#toc-the-sunk-cost-fallacy).
- The term *best practices* is relative. Best practices constantly evolve over time.
- Embrace unlearning and re-learning.
- Never settle in learning in-depth how something works.
- The most dangerous phrase: "we've always done it this way".
- Never be too busy to improve. Avoid being stuck in a hamster wheel of inefficiency.
- Put people over processes.
- Judge people on their contributions, not on how confident they seem.
- Don't let your own desire to get things done quickly, turn into undue pressure on peers.
- Success is not a zero-sum game, so be happy and content with others' success.
- Out of all the agile practices commonly used, estimating work items and trying to measure project velocity is the least productive.
- New systems are best designed by a small number of minds, not committees.
- Instead of only doing your part, help out in dependent workstreams too to fully understand the E2E.
- Your team is only as good as the weakest code reviewer.
- Don't get sucked into hyped/fashionable tech and understand that CS fundamentals don’t change much over time.
- Knowledge of specific frameworks, libraries or tools is not that important in the long run.
- Keep the docs as close to the actual source code as possible.
- All code in the critical path should have good tests, regardless if the tests were written first, last, or in the middle.
- Have the same high standards for all the code, from tests, little scripts to the inner loop of a critical system.
- Deploy from a main branch to an environment from the very beginning of a project.
- Don't implement in the app code, what can be configured through the infra.
- Automate all the things that are worth automating.
- Ensure the system is observable so that you can enquire at any time what is happening.
- As a Manager/Lead, if things go well, give your team the credit. If things go sideways, take the blame yourself.
