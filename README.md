### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Hassaan** (correct, it's not *Syed* ðŸ˜„). I'm a curious Engineering Manager with 15+ years of experience in developing Software and leading Engineering teams. I'm particularly passionate about Data and Analytics in the Cloud. Living in four countries has enabled me to effectively contribute in teams with diverse backgrounds. Working across industries such as Retail, Telco, AdTech, Manufacturing and Energy has helped me understand a wide array of business domains. 

In my current role at Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering (CSE), I lead a team of talented and meticulous developers that empower strategically important Microsoft Azure customers to drive the value of intelligent cloud through Software Engineering.

### Things I believe (*in no particular order*)

- [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
- Code is a liability, not an asset.
- Always keep learning. Teach yourself multiple ways of solving the same problem.
- The term *best practices* is relative. Best practices constantly evolve over time. Brace yourself to unlearn and re-learn.
- People over processes.
- Judge people on their contributions, not on how confident they seem.
- Don't let your own desire to get things done quickly turn into undue pressure on your peers.
- Out of all the agile practices commonly used, estimating work items and trying to measure project velocity is the least useful.
- New systems are best designed by a small number of minds, not committees.
- Your team is only as good as your weakest code reviewer.
- Beware of hyped or fashionable tech (looking at you Kubernetes ðŸ˜‰). CS fundamentals donâ€™t change much over time.
- Have the same high standards for all the code you write, from tests, little scripts to the inner loop of your critical system.
- It doesn't matter if you write the tests first, last, or in the middle, but all code must have good tests.
- Main branch should always be deployable to prod. Deploy from main to prod from the very beginning of a project.
- Automate all the things that can be automated.
- Being able to tell what your system is doing is crucial, so make sure itâ€™s observable.
- Choose your data storage backend according to the shape of data, types of queries, read/write patterns and performance requirements.
- As a manager/lead, if things go well, give your team the credit. If things go sideways, take the blame yourself.
